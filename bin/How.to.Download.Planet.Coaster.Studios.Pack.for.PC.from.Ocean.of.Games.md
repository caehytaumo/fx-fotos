Planet Coaster - Studios Pack is not only about creating your own movie-themed park, but also about experiencing the thrill of being a part of the action. The DLC comes with three new coasters that let you feel like a stunt performer or a movie star. Re-Motion is a suspended coaster that can rotate its seats to face different directions, allowing you to witness different scenes and effects along the track. Horror Heights is a drop tower that takes you through a haunted hotel with spooky surprises. Erie Elevation is a dark ride that combines a lift system with a trackless ride, taking you through a zombie-infested hospital.
 
If you are looking for some inspiration or guidance on how to use the new content, the DLC also includes 10 new scenarios and 93 new blueprints.

The blueprints provide you with ready-made buildings, rides, and scenes that you can place in your park or customize as you wish. You can also browse and download other players' creations from the Steam Workshop.
